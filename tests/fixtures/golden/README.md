# Golden Test Fixtures

This directory contains PMTiles files generated by tippecanoe for golden comparison testing.

## Generation

Golden tiles were generated using tippecanoe v2.49.0 with the following command pattern:

```bash
tippecanoe \
    -P \
    '--layer=<layer-name>' \
    '--maximum-zoom=10' \
    --simplify-only-low-zooms \
    --no-simplification-of-shared-nodes \
    --no-tile-size-limit \
    --no-feature-limit \
    --force \
    '--output=<output>.pmtiles' \
    '<input>.geojsonl'
```

### Key flags explained:

- `-P` / `--read-parallel`: Read input files in parallel
- `--simplify-only-low-zooms`: Only simplify at lower zoom levels (preserves detail at max zoom)
- `--no-simplification-of-shared-nodes`: Don't simplify nodes shared between features (prevents gaps)
- `--no-tile-size-limit`: Don't limit tile size (useful for testing)
- `--no-feature-limit`: Don't limit features per tile (useful for testing)
- `--force`: Overwrite output file if it exists

## Files

| File | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `open-buildings.pmtiles` | Microsoft Open Buildings (Andorra) | ~1000 building polygons |
| `fieldmaps-boundaries.pmtiles` | FieldMaps ADM boundaries | Administrative boundaries |
| `road-detections.pmtiles` | Road detection data | Road linestrings |

## Decoded Tiles

The `decoded/` subdirectory contains MVT tiles extracted from the PMTiles archives
and decoded to GeoJSON using ogr2ogr. These are used for golden comparison tests.

Extraction command:
```bash
pmtiles tile <archive>.pmtiles <z> <x> <y> > tile.mvt
ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON output.geojson tile.mvt
```

Note: Decoded GeoJSON uses tile-local coordinates (0-4096 extent), not geographic coordinates.

## Known Differences from Our Implementation

1. **Feature dropping**: Tippecanoe drops features at low zooms based on density.
   Our implementation doesn't do this yet (Phase 3). At z8, tippecanoe drops ~90%
   of features compared to our output.

2. **Tiny polygon reduction**: Tippecanoe uses diffuse probability for polygons
   smaller than 4 square subpixels. We don't implement this yet.

3. **Simplification tolerance**: We use the same Douglas-Peucker algorithm but
   may have slightly different tolerance calculations.
